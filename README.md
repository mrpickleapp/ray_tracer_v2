# ray_tracer_v2

This is a work in progress.

Running _windowTest5.exe launches a real-time physics 3D physics simulation rendered using a custom 3D ray-tracing graphics engine.

Can handle a number of primitive shapes, and complex shapes made up of primitives. Complex light behaviours are modelled, including reflection, refraction, total internal reflection, and partial versions of the above.
